# AS-IS
## The scenario is that the PE/PIE/FABModule engineers must be Knowlwdgeable, which means they must have the Domain knowledge, and need many SOPs to follow the  step by step analysis procedure to do the Engineering Data Analysis. It is current status of the old EDA system. And it’s correlation analysis only for some dimensions lacking holistic or complex combination
analysis.


 
# TO-BE
## The scenario is that PE/PIE/FABModule Engineers just provide the Good and Bad Wafer list, the new generation EDA system can automatically to fetch the related data such as MES data, Process data, FDC data, SPC data, CP or WAT data, Metrology data, and even the Material COA data.The system will implement the Machine Learning and Deep Learning even the AI(LLM) Model to automatically do the data insight analysis to identify the potential factor that will impact the wafer performance for Root Cause Analysis.
